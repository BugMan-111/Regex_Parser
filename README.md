# A simple Regex parser
The Implementation of a regular expression engine using NFA.It will be able to parse a given valid regular expression 
<br />
to a NFA(non-determinstic finite automata(machine)) which is represented by graph data strcutre. Then It will be able to allow users to input strings and it will help users to check 
<br />
wether these strings are matched with the given regular expression or not
<br />
<br />
To compile the code: javac *.java
<br />
(if you don't have Junit testing jar installed, delete the _Test.java)
<br />
<br />
There are two modes for users to choose:
<br />
<br />
To Run The Code:
<br />
java RegexEngine.java
<br />
The program will ask users to input one regular expression
<br />
The program will show users the NFA graph of the input regular expression
<br />
Then users will be able to input text strings, it will check wether strings are matched with the given regular expression
<br />
<br />
